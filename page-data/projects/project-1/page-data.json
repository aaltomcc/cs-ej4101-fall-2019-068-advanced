I understood that it was supposed to make development easier and reduce the amount of bugs in the code but that was about it. This course also felt like a good fit for the other course called Cloud Systems and Technologies which I also completed in this period. I expected that together these two courses would deepen my knwoledge about different software development lifecycles, especially the deployment and hosting parts. I also saw that the course project would possibly be a good opportunity to experiment with Gatsby and build a skeleton for a portfolio page I've been planning to do for a long time.</li>\n<li><strong>What I expected to learn on this course?</strong> I expected to deepen my knowledge in DevOps both the concept and the related technologies. In addition to that, experimenting with new technologies and building a webpage with a simple CI/CD pipeline was a major learning goal for this course. I was also hoping that this course would provide a bit of flexibility in terms of technolgies so that I'd be able to explore some technologies like Gatsby that were in my personal interest and maybe learn something completely unexpected.</li>\n<li><strong>Expectations about the workload.</strong> I knew the course was only one credit but on the other hand it's nice to have some extra time even for small course to really be able to take time and learn not just the compulsory parts of the course but also dive deep into some things that are not directly related to the completion of the course. I had enough time to complete the exercises and the workload was not too much, not too little. Although I wish I've had more time to explore this topic, but I think I'll be returning to this in my future work and studies.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 17, 2019","path":"/projects/project-1","title":"This course 068"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
