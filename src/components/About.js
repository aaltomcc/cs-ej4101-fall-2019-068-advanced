          Remember that both the repository source and the GitHub are public, so
          anyone can see what you write. If you feel uncomfortable in writing
          about yourself, write who you would like to be or just use a fictional
          character.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any case, do should not write any private information such as your
          student number, your date of birth, your address, and so on.
